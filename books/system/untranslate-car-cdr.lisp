; Proof of the Correctness of CADR Centric Untranslation
; J Strother Moore
; Georgetown, TX, October, 2014

; Abstract

; When ACL2 displays a formula to the user, it ``untranslates'' formal
; (internal-form) terms into terms involving macros.  For example, (CAR (CDR
; X)) is displayed as (CADR X).  Common Lisp provides 28 macros for the
; combinations of CARs and CDRs up to four deep.  Given all these available
; abbreviations how should (CAR (CDR (CDR (CAR (CDR X))))) be displayed?

; For the first 25 years of ACL2's history, the term above was displayed as
; (CADDAR (CDR X)).

; The code verified here displays it as (CADDR (CADR X)).

; The old method availed itself of all 28 of the car-cdr macros.  The new
; method only introduces 6 of them: CADR, CADDR, CADDDR, CDDR, CDDDR, CDDDDR.
; This code never introduces such macros as CAAR or CDDAAR, preferring CARs and
; CDRs when necessary.  Lisp programmers tend to recognize CADR, CADDR, and
; CADDDR as the accessors for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd (0-based) elements of a
; list.

; We call this style of untranslation ``CADR Centric'' because it emphasizes
; the most common use of the car-cdr macros: accessing particular elements of
; linear lists.

; Perhaps the most important advantage of CADR Centric untranslation is that it
; operates from the inside out, where the old method operated from the outside
; in.  The inside out approach is more likely to give related elements related
; names.  For example, consider the formula

; (p (car (cdr (car (cdr x))))
;    (car (cdr (cdr (car (cdr x))))))

; In the old style this would be displayed as

; (p (cadadr x)
;    (caddar (cdr x)))

; whereas in the new style it is displayed as

; (p (cadr (cadr x))
;    (caddr (cadr x)))

; which makes it clear that p is being applied to the 1st and 2nd elements of
; the 1st element of x.

; Because I found the code confusing, I decided to prove that the untranslation
; preserved the meaning of the original term.  The main theorem proved at the
; bottom of this book is:

; (DEFTHM UNTRANSLATE-CAR-CDR-NEST-CORRECT
;   (EQUAL (EVAD TERM ALIST)
;          (EVAD (UNTRANSLATE-CAR-CDR-NEST TERM) ALIST))
;   :RULE-CLASSES NIL)

; where evad is an ACL2 evaluator that can handle CAR, CDR, and the six macros
; possibly introduced by CADR Centric untranslation.  Note that evad cannot be
; introduced by defevaluator because that event only allows function symbols to
; be interpreted, whereas CADR, CDDR, etc., are macro symbols.  But the
; constraints on evad are exactly analogous to what defevaluator generates.
; For example,

; (DEFTHM EVAD-constraint-11
;   (IMPLIES (AND (CONSP X) (EQUAL (CAR X) 'CADDR))
;            (EQUAL (EVAD X A)
;                   (CADDR (EVAD (CADR X) A)))))

; Note also that UNTRANSLATE-CAR-CDR-NEST-CORRECT does not establish that
; untranslate-car-cdr-nest returns a well-formed term.

; The problem with well-formedness in this context is that there are two senses
; of that word: well-formed before untranslation and well-formed after
; untranslation.  In practice in the ACL2 system, the input to untranslation is
; a formal (``translated'') ACL2 term: no macros are used.  The output is
; ``well-formed'' in a different sense, meaning that the macros introduced
; expand without error.  For example, ACL2's untranslator may see
; (IF a b (IF c d e)) as input and return (COND (a b) (c d) (T e)) as
; input and they are well-formed in different senses.

; The function untranslate-car-cdr-nest verified here operates in two phases.
; Phase 1 extracts a list of As and Ds corresponding to the cAr and cDr symbols
; surrounding some base.  Phase 1 returns the list and the base.  Phase 2 then
; wraps a nest of the CADR Centric functions and macros around the base.  But
; when this code is used by ACL2's full untranslate mechanism, a recursive call
; of ACL2's mechanism is interposed on the base between phases 1 and 2.  Thus,
; the base identified by phase 1 is in translated form but the term supplied to
; phase 2 is in untranslated form.  Thus, the senses in which the inputs to
; phases 1 and 2 are well-formed are different.

; But in this book, we ignore ACL2's full untranslation mechanism.  We just
; compose phases 1 and 2, make no assumptions about the shapes of the terms
; being manipulated, and just prove that the input and output have the same
; meaning in the EVAD sense.
