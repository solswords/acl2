(in-package "ACL2")

;; Provides a way of finding certain rules about evaluators.  Not 100%
;; foolproof, but should be fairly reliable.

;; This is useful for defining evaluator-related utilities that work whether
;; the evaluator was defined with defevaluator or defevaluator-fast,
;; with :namedp t or nil, etc.

;; If this doesn't work as expected, it's because it's looking for certain
;; theorems in the world, and either:
;; -- it found one that seems to match, but wasn't the one you were thinking
;; of.  This could happen because a theorem was proved that was sufficiently
;; similar to the original that our matching was fooled.
;; -- it didn't find any.  This could happen if, say, the exact phrasing of the
;; evaluator theorems is changed.

;; find the ev-lst function given the ev function or vice versa.  Should be its
;; only sibling.
